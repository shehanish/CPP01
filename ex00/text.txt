- Every new must matched with a delete
	-if you use new[] use delete[]

Zombie.hpp        → Class declaration
Zombie.cpp        → Class method definitions (constructor, destructor, announce)
newZombie.cpp     → Function: creates zombie on heap
randomChump.cpp   → Function: creates zombie on stack
main.cpp          → Calls both functions and shows the difference

| Feature          | **Stack**                   | **Heap**                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Allocation**   | Automatic                   | Manual (`new`, `delete`)    |
| **Deallocation** | Automatic (when scope ends) | Manual (you must `delete`)  |
| **Speed**        | Very fast                   | Slower                      |
| **Memory size**  | Limited                     | Much larger                 |
| **Lifetime**     | Tied to scope               | Controlled by programmer    |
| **Syntax**       | `Zombie z;`                 | `Zombie* z = new Zombie();` |
| **Destruction**  | Happens automatically       | You must call `delete z;`   |
